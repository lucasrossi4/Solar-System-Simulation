# Solar-System-Simulation

This project simulates planetary motion under the influence of gravity. Using numerical integration, it calculates the trajectories of planets in a simplified solar system model. The primary goal is to study how celestial bodies move under gravitational forces, specifically considering the Sun's effect and optionally including Jupiter's gravitational influence. The simulation employs mathematical models to update planetary positions and visualize their orbits over time.

The project provides a set of Python functions for computing planetary orbits, distances, and accelerations. The simulation starts by loading planet data from planets.csv, converting orbital parameters into a numerical format, and applying physics-based calculations to determine trajectories. Users can analyze the effects of gravity by running the script and visualizing the results. API tests are included to verify the correctness of implemented functions.
